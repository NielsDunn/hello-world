# hello-world
My name's Niels Dunn. I've loved videogames and cartoons ever since I was a kid. That's why I'm glad that I can finally make them on my own. Like I said in class, I own every Godzilla movie ever made, and several other hokey Kaiju films. I'm excited to learn how to rig and animate more properly in this class.
